# Ruby2D Portfolio Landing Page

This is a player select screen project built with Ruby2D, which has been refactored using OOP principles and enhanced for readability. I built it as a landing page for my portfolio site, but can be easily changed to be used as a landing page for any website or other purposes.

## Features

- Style website links as colorful, animated player sprites
- Easily customizable to fit your personal branding
- Built with Ruby2D, a simple and easy-to-use 2D game development library for Ruby

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. Make sure you have Ruby2D installed on your system. You can follow the instructions on the [official Ruby2D website](https://www.ruby2d.com/learn/get-started/) to install it.

3. Navigate to the project directory and run the following command to start the app:

 ```ruby
 ruby app.rb
 ```
4. The player select screen will be displayed in your default web browser. Customize the screen by modifying the `select_screen.rb` file to include your own branding and personal information.

5. Use this project as a landing page for your portfolio website or any other website!
